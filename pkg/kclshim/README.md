KCL shim allows you to create Eno Synthesizers with [KCL](https://www.kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour).

Here is how to use KCL shim.

1. Create a folder and write your KCLs. Take [this](./example_synthesizer/main.k) as an example.
2. Write a main.go and call `Synthesize()` in [kcl.go](./kcl.go)
