          Compositions represent a collection of related, synthesized resources.


          For example: when managing Postgres with Eno, one would create a composition
          per distinct instance of Postgres, all referencing a single synthesizer resource.


          Changing the spec of a composition will result in re-synthesis.


          Eno guarantees that a composition's resources will be deleted before the composition
          finishes deletion by holding a finalizer on it. To delete the composition while leaving
          the resources in place, set the annotation `eno.azure.io/reconcile-interval` to "orphan".

                  Synthesizers can accept Kubernetes resources as inputs.
                  Bindings allow compositions to specify which resource to use for a particular input "reference".
