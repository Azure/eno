          Synthesizers are any process that can run in a Kubernetes container that implements the [KRM Functions Specification](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/api-conventions/functions-spec.md).

          Synthesizer processes are given some metadata about the composition they are synthesizing, and are expected
          to return a set of Kubernetes resources. Essentially they generate the desired state for a set of Kubernetes resources.

                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                        Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
