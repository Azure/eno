          Synthesizers are any process that can run in a Kubernetes container that implements the [KRM Functions Specification](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/api-conventions/functions-spec.md).


          Synthesizer processes are given some metadata about the composition they are synthesizing, and are expected
          to return a set of Kubernetes resources. Essentially they generate the desired state for a set of Kubernetes resources.

                  Pods are recreated after they've existed for at least the pod timeout interval.
