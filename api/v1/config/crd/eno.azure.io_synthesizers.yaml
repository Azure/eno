          Synthesizers are any process that can run in a Kubernetes container that implements the [KRM Functions Specification](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/api-conventions/functions-spec.md).


          Synthesizer processes are given some metadata about the composition they are synthesizing, and are expected
          to return a set of Kubernetes resources. Essentially they generate the desired state for a set of Kubernetes resources.

                    Ref defines a synthesizer input.
                    Inputs are typed using the Kubernetes API - they are just normal Kubernetes resources.
                    The consumer (synthesizer) specifies the resource's kind/group,
                    while the producer (composition) specifies a specific resource name/namespace.


                    Compositions that use the synthesizer will be re-synthesized when the resource bound to this ref changes.
                    Re-synthesis happens automatically while honoring the globally configured cooldown period.

                        deferred input will respect the cooldown period.
