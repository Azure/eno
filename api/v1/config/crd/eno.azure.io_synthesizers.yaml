              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

              Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
              Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.

                  Pods are recreated after they've existed for at least the pod timeout interval.
                  This helps close the loop in failure modes where a pod may be considered ready but not actually able to run.

                  Synthesized resources can optionally be reconciled at a given interval.
                  Per-resource jitter will be applied to avoid spikes in request rate.

                        A non-deferred input will trigger a synthesis immediately, whereas a
                        deferred input will respect the cooldown period.
